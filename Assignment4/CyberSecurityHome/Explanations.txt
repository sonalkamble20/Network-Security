\f0\b\fs26 \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This updates my system. The first part (
\f2\fs26 apt update
\f1\fs24 ) refreshes the list of available software packages, and the second part (
\f2\fs26 apt upgrade
\f1\fs24 ) actually installs the latest versions. The 
\f2\fs26 -y
\f1\fs24  just saves me from having to press \'93yes\'94 each time. Basically, it keeps my machine up to date and secure.\

\f0\b\fs26 mkdir ~/lab4
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This just makes a new folder called 
\f2\fs26 lab4
\f1\fs24  inside my home directory. I used it to keep everything for this lab in one place.\

\f0\b\fs26 cd ~/lab4
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 I moved into the 
\f2\fs26 lab4
\f1\fs24  folder so all the work I do happens inside there instead of cluttering other folders.\

\f0\b\fs26 sudo apt install nmap -y
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This installs 
\f3\b Nmap
\f1\b0 , which is a network scanning tool. I\'92ll be using Nmap a lot for this lab to explore networks.\

\f0\b\fs26 nmap -sn 127.0.0.1
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This runs a \'93ping scan\'94 against my own machine (
\f2\fs26 127.0.0.1
\f1\fs24  is the loopback address). It\'92s just a quick way to check that Nmap is working properly.\

\f0\b\fs26 ifconfig
\f3\fs24  (or 
\f0\fs26 ip a
\f3\fs24 )
\f1\b0 \uc0\u8232 This shows me the network interfaces and IP addresses my VM is using. I needed this to figure out my machine\'92s private IP on the network.\

\f0\b\fs26 netstat -tuln
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This shows open ports and which services are listening. For example, I could see SSH running on port 22.\

\f0\b\fs26 lsof -i -P -n
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This is similar to 
\f2\fs26 netstat
\f1\fs24  but gives more detail, like which program is tied to which port. Good for checking what\'92s running.\

\f0\b\fs26 sudo nmap -sV localhost
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This scans my machine and tries to identify the versions of the services running. For example, I could see the exact version of SSH and CUPS.\

\f0\b\fs26 sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This does a \'93ping sweep\'94 on my local subnet. It tries to find all the machines that are alive in the 
\f2\fs26 192.168.1.x
\f1\fs24  range.\

\f0\b\fs26 sudo nmap --script vuln localhost
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This uses Nmap\'92s vulnerability scripts to check my machine for common known issues. It\'92s a simple way to test for weaknesses.\

\f0\b\fs26 sudo tcpdump -i eth0
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This captures raw network traffic on the 
\f2\fs26 eth0
\f1\fs24  interface. My VM didn\'92t have 
\f2\fs26 eth0
\f1\fs24  (it had 
\f2\fs26 ens160
\f1\fs24 ), but the point is that tcpdump lets you actually see packets moving in real time.\

\f0\b\fs26 watch -n 1 netstat -tulnp
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This re-runs the 
\f2\fs26 netstat
\f1\fs24  command every second so I can watch open ports and connections in real time, almost like a live feed.\

\f0\b\fs26 sudo ufw status verbose
\f1\b0\fs24 \uc0\u8232 This checks the firewall (UFW = Uncomplicated Firewall). Mine showed as inactive, which means the firewall wasn\'92t blocking anything.\
